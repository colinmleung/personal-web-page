			<h1>The Work Journal - November 3</h1>

			<p>Have problems concentrating on work? Don't know what to work on next, or feel like you'll never finish that side project? The modern world is filled with enough funny cat videos to keep anyone from productive work. Perhaps you're tried to-do lists. Great for offloading menial tasks no doubt, but you may have found them unsuitable for planning more ambitious projects.</p>

			<p>I've been keeping what one might call a "work journal". It's exactly what it sounds like, a place to regularly write about topics related to your work. What separates a work journal from system such as the to-do list, is a heavy emphasis on thoughtfulness. Being consistently thoughful solves a multitude of common productivity issues. Don't know what to work on next? Read your journal a few entries back to see what you are supposed to do. Constantly wasting time on the internet? Set aside a regular time for entry writing to serve as a distraction to your distractions. I also find that writing about the work I'm supposed to do gets me more interested in doing it.</p>

			<p>Here's my personal implementation of the work journal. Working can be seen as a three step process: planning, execution, and reflection. I use my work journal primarily for planning and reflection.</p>

			<h2>Planning</h2>

			<p>Planning involves two distince tasks. Breaking down large tasks into smaller ones, and mapping these milestones accurately onto some time scale. I only plan out as far as the a semester (four months), anything further would be too speculative. I've developed a useful rule-of-thumb that let's me create plans more efficiently.<p>

			<p>Just-In-Time Rule: At the beginning of every time unit (semester, month, etc.), plan out all the milestones of the time unit one level below it.</p>

			<p>For example, at the beginning of a semester, plan out what you expect to achieve at the end of every month in that semester. Similarly, at the beginning of every month, plan out what you expect to achieve at the end of every week in that month. With this rule, you should find yourself forced to create realistic and achievable milestones at every level, without getting bogged down in insignificant details.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>

			<p>Most people work. Fewer plan, and fewer still reflect on their work. And yet of all the three stages of work I mentioned before, reflection yields the most opportunity for productive change. How you implement reflection in your work journal is another thing entirely. It can be simple, perhaps just answering the question "What did I do today?". Or it could be a multi-faceted questionnaire: What issues prevented me from doing work? What are the root causes of these issues? How can I prevent these issues from occuring in the future?</p>

			<p>I have another rule that I like to use when deciding how detailed my reflection is. The longer the time scale you're reflection on, the more appropriate it is to ask complex questions. It is difficult to find habitual patterns within the journal entry for a single day, but looking at all the entries over a month should proffer some useful data to act upon.</p>

			<p>In tbis blog post, I've introduced the concept of the work journal, explain its benefits, and given some actionable advice to make the journal more effective. Best of luck in implementing your own.</p>
