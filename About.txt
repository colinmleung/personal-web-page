Hi, my name is Colin Leung. I'm a fifth year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia. I'm interested in a lot of things: politics, economics, sociology, technology, and business.

I've built user interfaces for signal processing applications, designed image analysis algorithms to analyze microscopic cement images, and created test environments to help reduce system-on-chip power consumption.

I'm currently working on a productivity application that helps you reflect on your work, detect unproductive patterns, and replace these habits with better ones.
